# Medihelp.AI
Welcome to the MediHelp AI repository! This project showcases our efforts in developing a chatbot powered by trusted medical sources. MediHelp.AI provides accurate solutions to health-related issues by referencing verified medical sources. The chatbot delivers clear answers along with their sources, ensuring users receive reliable and authentic health information without generating unsupported content.
## About the Project
We have developed a chatbot designed to assist with health-related issues. It uses information from various medical books to provide accurate solutions. When a user asks about a health problem, the chatbot delivers a specific answer along with the source of the information. It does not generate content beyond what is available in trusted medical texts. This ensures users receive reliable and understandable health advice.

4. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

5. 27th Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery

12. Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology (14th Edition)

And many more books..........


## Future Work
We are committed to continuously improving our chatbot’s performance by adding more medical books in the database.

## *Note
For some restrictions we can't upload the files of the books so we hope you create your own database using these books or your preferred books. And also you have to create a .env file containing your "PINECONE_INDEX_NAME", "PINECONE_API_KEY", "PINECONE_ENV" and "HF_TOKEN".
